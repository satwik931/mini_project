“How’s your day” my last time this week I can ask this and the two days are followed by weekend and there’s no point of this question. 
And there he walked silent again. How should I consider this ‘Not replying’ how fair it is? 
“Rohan, you know what happened in our office today?” my excitement makes him walk from the room he was in. 
Life is feeling like hell. I just want to skip this part of my life. The only way to make his mind calm is to write a written letter elaborating everything: the reason behind my behaviour, implementations I do in future so that I don’t repeat, the significance of this punishment and how did it helped me. All this and then he reads and forgives me. Life’s hard for everyone? Not sure but with writers and over emotional people it feels worse.
The next two days we stay together for the whole day and I don’t want us to act weird. So with my eyes filled with tears I wrote a letter apologising for not committing any mistake. This is the seed of my thoughts weather to reconsider him. Nothing is worse than failing for Many years of understanding and it ultimately turning misunderstanding. Your whole life is a lie. No one’s good. Being with ourselves, giving a decent amount of time for entertainment watching TV shows, meditating for a 1 hour in a day, weekends with parents…all this is enough, but then we choose to be with someone and everything gets ruined. We loose our mental peace. 
Every night I direct towards him with my eyes open hoping he would turn my side and we sleep together. But he sleeps in the same direction as me and every time all I see is everything except his face which I previously used to kiss all over. He knows how to cook and that makes him more independent. Wish uncle haven’t taught him that, now there’s nothing on which he relays on me. The art of overcoming the basic needs like food, shelter, sex have been mastered by him and that’s making him inhumanly human being. 
For hours I think if there’s anything he depends on me and I find nothing. He can live without me but the reverse is unimaginable. Going to a state of enjoying own company is difficult and ones achieved there’s no turning back. 
Oh my god he’s reading the letter which I kept on the bed. 
Ugh..after days I saw that usual he smile he gives after evalatuting my letter. Not joking when you see the letter now it will have underlined and circle parts added with his pen. He stores it in the desk and god knows why. Maybe it’s for proof if I didn’t change my behaviour as written. Luckily I didn’t get a chance to know why he preserve all those lies I write just to talk with him. 
“I’m sorry. Never I say that again. That day I didn’t mean what you thought. I’m exrtremely sorry,” my hands crossed, touching my ears and apologising. Is this called domination? If yes, I hate that.  
“Atleast you leant something. Not to say those things even unintentionally,” said Rohan. 
“You know how much I missed you,” was his second sentence and he pulled me closer and I know now this talk is going to be for whole night. This baby has a lot inside his head but can act as if he isn’t missing. 
Now I do the same thing he did ghosting me, but then he knows how to behave and act like he don’t want me. How can he control this much of love? Lovely weird Rohan. 
“You could’ve talked to me dear, how many times I asked about your day and kept quite” I broke into tears seeing my baby’s excitement. 
“But Usha, it won’t work like that. You
