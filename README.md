“You’ll never truly understand this unless you’re in our position. Just leave it.” He ignored all the examples and analogies I tried. 
We had half an hour before Usha actually arrived. In the meantime, we walked around, and I shared stories about my childhood with him; who I used to hang out with, and every little detail about my hometown. Now that he knows the people well, he can relate to how things used to be. 
“Oh, So the Madhav you’re talking about is your best friend?” he asked as if he knew Madhav. 
“More like a family we are” I said, since his name kept coming up in all the stories I shared. 
“Not more like a, you are a family” he replied. Now the family tree got enlarged. 
“Shwetha is my own sister” he added. 
“No surprise. Your whole family revolves around me without even realizing it.” I wasn’t surprised. They changed my parents, after all. Nothing else could shock me now. 
“Are there any other people I should know about? The milkman, the newspaper guy…they were also connected to our family, right?”
“Hahaha, we used to live in Hyderabad I don’t know if you had the same newspaper guy in your city. By the way, I still don’t know why you all moved to Vizag” He didn’t pick up on my sarcasm. 
“Honestly, up to this point, I always believed I was born in Vishakhapatnam.” Even my parents didn’t mention anything about my birthplace. 
“Surprising that you didn’t see any of Usha’s photo from the childhood. They really don’t talk about her? At least somewhere they could’ve mentioned something about her. Their only daughter she is” he enquired. And I don’t remember anything like that. Not a single photo of her was there in my house. Even in Shwetha’s house I didn’t see any Rohan’s photo. 
“You know the reason that made them separate and develop so much hatred toward their only daughter, cutting off all ties?” I asked, hoping he would know, that he can only say this part of the story without having bias towards anyone.  
“No, we had a fight, and one day she just disappeared to her home. She called me when she reached and told me not to come to her place unless she let me know”
“I respected what she said and didn’t attempt to visit. One day, just a week before you were born, Sudha called me over to her place. She apologized and broke down in tears. “I tried convincing her so much, but she’s not listening to me. I’m sorry, Rohan,” were her last words to me,” said Rohan. But I don’t get the point of respecting boundaries here, if it meant being separated forever, then respecting them doesn’t make sense. He should have tried harder to talk to her, instead of just staying silent. 
“But you didn’t request Usha” I asked. 
“I did.  But her father was firmly saying, “We’ll only send our daughter if she’s willing to go.” He always pretends to be this big man of values and expects us to see him that way. Idiot.” He was harsh with my father, and I really wanted to defend him, but his role in my life is different from his. I can understand his frustration.
But I could divert the topic from my dad, so I said, “Many times, Usha mentioned that Sudha wasn’t on her side, and that made her angry.” 
“That’s why I love Suha the most. She’s like that. She will never be biased and thinks like grown. But all these others seem to think they should rule the world, and everyone should talk about their kingdom.” he concluded his rant, and I don’t want to extend this conversation. In my experience, everyone was good to me, so I can’t connect with what he’s saying at all. 
After a few minutes of silence, he asked “Do you know if Usha had any romantic or other kinds of relational affairs these days?”
“Yes, I guess so. Not Sure. Before I come here, she’s with Kamlesh, who works in her office. Married guy” I told him what I know. 
“This is what independence means to them. No one should stop them, they do whatever they feel like and convince themselves that their mistakes are somehow making them wiser. This is what your generational people follow, right?” He fired the question, annoyed and continued “Even your Usha feels young doing this shit”
“Not everything needs to be learned through personal experience; sometimes you can just listen to those who’ve already been through it.” He threw out some other life quote. 
“Sudha would have said no to the job too, which is why she became the villain, even after supporting Usha so many times, including when it came to our marriage.”
“Job?” I asked confused. 
“Oh, you don’t know right? All of this started because her husband, who had a low-paying job, told his high-earning wife to quit hers.” I didn’t get why he is comparing the pay. 
“Oh, she used to earn more than you?” I asked. 
“Not now. But yeah, initially her pay was almost double to that of mine?” he replied. I was shocked when he said it’s two times more. 
“Why did you ask her to quit the job?” I continued the follow questions. 
That was when you were about to be born, so I asked her to quit her job for just three years to look after you” he responded. 
“Okay. But that’s reasonable. What else she expects?” I asked, unsure if this was what led to their divorce. 
“She expects me to do that. She wanted that job” What the hell, doesn’t he feel weird staying home while she works? 
“How can a man be at home?” I asked because I genuinely wanted to know. 
“It’s been twenty years, and people still think the same way. Or perhaps growing up with the older generation influenced your mindset in that way” He was happy that I shared the same opinion. 
“Maybe. I don’t know. You acted right. You said it was just for a few years, not that she should give up her career forever, right?” I reassured with him. 
“Tell her the same, she’ll be here in a few minutes” we ended our conversation and waited for her. 
*** 
I saw her coming toward our car on her scooty. She stopped and pulled out an old book from it. 
“Hi Amma” I addressed her, knowing now how much happiness this name gives her. She tightly hugged me hearing me calling that. She gave Rohan a top-to-bottom glance and then spoke. “Come, let’s go we don’t need anyone’s help” that ‘anyone’ there referred to Rohan. 
“I’ll agree to come with you only if you take me to see my mother” I demanded by side conditions since she mentioned she knew where my mother is. 
“But I’m your mother” she played smart. 
“Either you accept being with me and Sudha, or you can’t be with just me,” part of me liked Usha so much that I’d be happiest person if she agreed for it. 
“You can be with me saran” Rohan interrupted. 
“That’s never an option,” she blurted out, hesitantly. 
Rohan began to raise his voice in response to her careless reaction. “He’s not just your son, and if you can break the rules, then so can I” 
I subconsciously forgot that even Rohan has right on me I wasn’t happy with both of them fighting over me. “So we’re back to your original terms. Drop me off at Sudha’s place and act like we have never met” I gave them an another option in order not hurt anyone. 
“No I can’t do that, I need you” Usha’s affection grew strong within just a few weeks. A mother’s love, once formed, is impossible to detach.
“See your father doesn’t say that,” she pointed Rohan. 
“If saying it were enough to make it real, I’d say it all my life.” he replied. Aww, it felt nice. Just because they aren’t expressive doesn’t mean they don’t feel anything in their heart. 
“Write these cheesy lines in your book. Don’t manipulate him” She dismissed those compliments in seconds. 
“There’s some other option, you’re not thinking of that” I hinted, having plans of making them together. 
Took a moment, a deep breath and revealed, “You can be together, and I bring Sudha as well. So, we all can be a family”
“That’s never going to happen” she responded in a split second.
“What’s problem with you Usha” Rohan asked, genuinely concerned by her reply. 
“You. What’s new problem?” I didn’t see this side of unfiltered Usha. Speaking bluntly, without thinking about whether it hurts others.
“Twenty years it’s been you still think about those 6 months we had after our marriage” He asked, nearly in tears. 
“Those six months were enough to ruin the past six years of our relationship and to make it clear that our future together wouldn’t work either.”
He walked closed towards her and gently asked, “Did I really say something that harsh? Why do you feel so unhappy living with me?” 
Immediately she moved away, showing the book in his hand, she whispered, “You know what this diary is?” took a pause, staring at his teary eyes, “It has every reason why I feel you’re not right for me. You’ve always said that writing brings clarity, so I used that approach to make my reasons clear”
“I meant sharing good memories or words, so that when we read them again, it brings us closer.” he touched the diary in her hand. 
“I sensed the other side of the coin. So, whenever loneliness hits or I start missing you, I read through what I’ve written in this book. It helps me remember why we’re not right for each other.” she built hate on him in a very organised manner. 
“Can I read that diary?” I tried grabbing it to know what is there in it. 
“No, I don’t want to ruin your impression on your dad. It’s the way he behaved to me, it has nothing to do with your bond” it made sense, and I let it go not trying to grasp it. 
“Even I don’t believe I did everything you mentioned there. Were those just your assumptions?” Rohan mentioned. 
“Why would I do that? I’m not crazy.” she didn’t agree on that. 
“Because you already had it in your mind to leave me, so no matter what I did, you saw everything in a negative light.” he explained the reason behind his claim. 
“You don’t know how many times I tried convincing myself not to get divorce. But I didn’t find any solid reason living with you. I used to cry everyday during my pregnancy, not able to figure out what to do. Meanwhile my mother, she assumes you were something ideal and she thinks I commit mistakes” now I get it why she’s mad on Sudha. 
“Now you understood how it felt when my father convinced me similar that I was the fault in our relationship. I acted and killed my attitude and stayed with you all those months” this part I have no clue what they are talking about. 
“That’s exactly why we chose to separate, for the best interests of both of us. And that’s one of our best decisions in both our lives. We are not meant to be together” I understood that my plans of being together with both have no scope. 
*******
I declared everything, my opinion was clear now, nothing changed. I don’t want him and that’s final.
“Okay. Don’t want to be with me, okay? But what makes me less deserving for having saran in my life?” he asked. His cry was more that I’m having him not because he doesn’t get a chance to be with him. 
“Even, I feel being with him Rohan, Usha” the kid let his opinion out. Seeing those fancy cars, luxury house he got tempted. Being more with him convinces only he wants his mother. I’m confident. 
“Fine. First, let’s see if Sudha agrees to this” saran added. Which was true, I know about my mother on that day she was very strict saying either both of you don’t deserve the kid or be together. 
“If she agrees, then what?” rohan asked. 
“The same that you use to do with your parents. Half of the year he spends with me and the rest half with you”
“Don’t worry much. I didn’t apply for job, after my convocation I get one and I will settle in that city. And always my first home will be where Sudha is. If you will be together then I’ll consider that as my second home or else forget it. One thing is for sure, these six months rule I’m against it”
“Then forget your second home” I responded. 
“Usha, we’re having him after years and it’s our responsibility to look after him, doing his marriage, and many things. How long sudha should have that burden?”
“So in this way you plan to be with me, huh? I know one day this is going to happen. Only our son will be the reason for us being together”
“Years passed, still the same Usha I see. Selfish one who doesn’t care about anyone”
“Yes, as you said I can’t be a good mother”
“Who said that I said that?”
“Tell me you didn’t say that?”
“No I was not meant what you exactly think?”
“Whatever it is, even the basic meaning of it conveys too harsh”
He came close to me, holding my hand “Usha what I meant is…”
I interrupted, “There I can see some police man. I request you to not let me create a scene here” now him holding hands feel like stranger forcing a woman. 
“On the day, I made a phone call to Uncle to discuss that I wanted to continue my job. Then he spoke same like you. He asked to discontinue for a few years.more than half and hour I explained him everything about my project and told him that this was very important”
“And in the end, he didn’t listen. I was still trying to convince. Finally he said, “Rohan is right, you can never be a good mother”” that was the moment I decided not to have you in my life”
“the worst part of my life didn’t even come to close, when I discussed this with my mother, she almost said the same. That’s when I decided to not have her in my life. If no one supports my career why did they spent lakhs for my study. I was the one carrying baby, I’m alright but you all were suffering. I hated that”
“And what did your father say?” Rohan asked, he now blames him for no reason. 
“you’re happy that he’s dead now? Always complaining about him, no”
“Just give an answer”
“He supported me, he said if you think you can manage both, just do it he said”
“And what if you couldn’t manage?” he acted like my father asking for the second option. 
“I didn’t get a chance though”
“No, I’m asking what if you couldn’t able to manage. Remember he always say have a second opinion on everything”
“So? That time he didn’t say like that and I expect to be my side”
“That’s the problem with you. You expect to be on your side, we stand on the right side”
“There’s nothing right or wrong, it’s just perception. You feel it would become difficult to manage both my career and raise the kid. I was confident that I can manage, that’s it”
“yes maybe you can manage but that doesn't produce a kid how he used to be. Motherless behaviour the society gives him that tag”
“You’re thinking too much. Also as an alternate option didn’t I mention about the baby care centres”
“Those won’t work usha” he said as if he’s gone through a few. 
“Sudha will never be biased and that’s why she didn’t support you though you’re her daughter” 
“Okay. I agree. But I expect to stand on my side. Otherwise where’s love”
“Love is not standing on by your side though you are wrong. It’s about correcting you”
“I’m never wrong. Don’t manipulate me”
“Okay. Fine”
“By the way sorry for saying those words to you”
“Your sorry is a way too late and can never fix any broken part of me. I carried those words for twenty years and will carry until my last breath”
“If that’s the case, I always wanted you to say this, you can never be a father”
“Usha, it’s not like revenge. Since he said those, now I’ll say. What are you, a small kid or what?”
“Saran, stay out of it. Let us deal with it”
“Don’t get me in the wrong way rohan. I see all your interviews, I still admire you a lot. You’re the best when it comes to writing, producing a film, making blockbuster music albums, many more you do…”
“Don’t just say to sooth me now. Fine. I don’t take your words to the heart”
“Wait. Let me complete it”
“Dealing with woman is a different thing rohan. You lack those qualities. First major part about it is understanding them. But you always feel you are right. You never be in that receiving position. You will listen but will not implement. You stick to your definitions, though they are outdated you never correct them. And this quality sucks and makes you a bad father. Because a father should fist be a husband and there you are a utterly failed one”
”Yeah, I understand” 
“Dad, you’re accepting just like that?”
“Your father has this rule son, now I am not in a position of listening since I am angry, so he stays calm and expects me to change. These principles are the reason for him being like that. Let him. He deserves”
“You are too harsh”
“Yes, only because I planned a whole life with him and it turned be a single mother. Every word came from the bottom of my heart and I mean every single word”
“Goodbye”
“Saran you are coming with me, if you want to see Sudha”
“Yes, I’m coming and decided not to be with any of you two”
“Your wish, I feel like talking with my mother for one last time, I drop you there and leave”
“Can I also come, don’t know how many years she lives. One last time I too wanted to talk with her. She’s one of my favourite human beings”
“One last ride” his eyes are completely filled with tears.
“Okay” we three started to sudha’s place.
