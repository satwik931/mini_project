The cover features the two faces (from Image 1), but instead of facing away afar, their silhouettes curve toward each other at the top, “merging” near the top center, symbolizing unity or connection.
The joining/merging curve should have a “opening” or “tear” toward the bottom, like a torn page or a zipper being pulled open.
In the opening at the bottom, the illustration from Image 2 (the woman and child sitting together) is revealed, as if peeking through the tear/zip.
The background color can be replaced with any warm color that suits well. 
Along the curve/opening, there are vintage letter textures, small brown-colored letterforms, and tiny book icons scattered subtly. 
At the top of the cover, the title appears:
"Two Places I Belong"
(with the font that fits)
