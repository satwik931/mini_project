“You’ll never truly understand this unless you’re in our position. Just leave it.” He ignored all the examples and analogies I tried. 
We had half an hour before Usha actually arrived. In the meantime, we walked around, and I shared stories about my childhood with him; who I used to hang out with, and every little detail about my hometown. Now that he knows the people well, he can relate to how things used to be. 
“Oh, So the Madhav you’re talking about is your best friend?” he asked as if he knew Madhav. 
“More like a family we are” I said, since his name kept coming up in all the stories I shared. 
“Not more like a, you are a family” he replied. Now the family tree got enlarged. 
“Shwetha is my own sister” he added. 
“No surprise. Your whole family revolves around me without even realizing it.” I wasn’t surprised. They changed my parents, after all. Nothing else could shock me now. 
“Are there any other people I should know about? The milkman, the newspaper guy…they were also connected to our family, right?”
“Hahaha, we used to live in Hyderabad I don’t know if you had the same newspaper guy in your city. By the way, I still don’t know why you all moved to Vizag” He didn’t pick up on my sarcasm. 
“Honestly, up to this point, I always believed I was born in Vishakhapatnam.” Even my parents didn’t mention anything about my birthplace. 
“Surprising that you didn’t see any of Usha’s photo from the childhood. They really don’t talk about her? At least somewhere they could’ve mentioned something about her. Their only daughter she is” he enquired. And I don’t remember anything like that. Not a single photo of her was there in my house. Even in Shwetha’s house I didn’t see any Rohan’s photo. 
“You know the reason that made them separate and develop so much hatred toward their only daughter, cutting off all ties?” I asked, hoping he would know, that he can only say this part of the story without having bias towards anyone.  
“No, we had a fight, and one day she just disappeared to her home. She called me when she reached and told me not to come to her place unless she let me know”
“I respected what she said and didn’t attempt to visit. One day, just a week before you were born, Sudha called me over to her place. She apologized and broke down in tears. “I tried convincing her so much, but she’s not listening to me. I’m sorry, Rohan,” were her last words to me,” said Rohan. But I don’t get the point of respecting boundaries here, if it meant being separated forever, then respecting them doesn’t make sense. He should have tried harder to talk to her, instead of just staying silent. 
“But you didn’t request Usha” I asked. 
“I did.  But her father was firmly saying, “We’ll only send our daughter if she’s willing to go.” He always pretends to be this big man of values and expects us to see him that way. Idiot.” He was harsh with my father, and I really wanted to defend him, but his role in my life is different from his. I can understand his frustration.
But I could divert the topic from my dad, so I said, “Many times, Usha mentioned that Sudha wasn’t on her side, and that made her angry.” 
“That’s why I love Suha the most. She’s like that. She will never be biased and thinks like grown. But all these others seem to think they should rule the world, and everyone should talk about their kingdom.” he concluded his rant, and I don’t want to extend this conversation. In my experience, everyone was good to me, so I can’t connect with what he’s saying at all. 
After a few minutes of silence, he asked “Do you know if Usha had any romantic or other kinds of relational affairs these days?”
“Yes, I guess so. Not Sure. Before I come here, she’s with Kamlesh, who works in her office. Married guy” I told him what I know. 
“This is what independence means to them. No one should stop them, they do whatever they feel like and convince themselves that their mistakes are somehow making them wiser. This is what your generational people follow, right?” He fired the question, annoyed and continued “Even your Usha feels young doing this shit”
“Not everything needs to be learned through personal experience; sometimes you can just listen to those who’ve already been through it.” He threw out some other life quote. 
“Sudha would have said no to the job too, which is why she became the villain, even after supporting Usha so many times, including when it came to our marriage.”
“Job?” I asked confused. 
“Oh, you don’t know right? All of this started because her husband, who had a low-paying job, told his high-earning wife to quit hers.” I didn’t get why he is comparing the pay. 
“Oh, she used to earn more than you?” I asked. 
“Not now. But yeah, initially her pay was almost double to that of mine?” he replied. I was shocked when he said it’s two times more. 
“Why did you ask her to quit the job?” I continued the follow questions. 
That was when you were about to be born, so I asked her to quit her job for just three years to look after you” he responded. 
“Okay. But that’s reasonable. What else she expects?” I asked, unsure if this was what led to their divorce. 
“She expects me to do that. She wanted that job” What the hell, doesn’t he feel weird staying home while she works? 
“How can a man be at home?” I asked because I genuinely wanted to know. 
“It’s been twenty years, and people still think the same way. Or perhaps growing up with the older generation influenced your mindset in that way” He was happy that I shared the same opinion. 
“Maybe. I don’t know. You acted right. You said it was just for a few years, not that she should give up her career forever, right?” I reassured with him. 
“Tell her the same, she’ll be here in a few minutes” we ended our conversation and waited for her. 
*** 
I saw her coming toward our car on her scooty. She stopped and pulled out an old book from it. 
“Hi Amma” I addressed her, knowing now how much happiness this name gives her. She tightly hugged me hearing me calling that. She gave Rohan a top-to-bottom glance and then spoke. “Come, let’s go we don’t need anyone’s help” that ‘anyone’ there referred to Rohan. 
“I’ll agree to come with you only if you take me to see my mother” I demanded my side conditions since she mentioned she knew where my mother is. 
“But I’m your mother” she played smart. 
“Either you accept being with me and Sudha, or you can’t be with just me,” part of me liked Usha so much that I’d be happiest person if she agreed for it. 
“You can be with me saran” Rohan interrupted. 
“That’s never an option,” she blurted out, hesitantly. 
Rohan began to raise his voice in response to her careless reaction. “He’s not just your son, and if you can break the rules, then so can I” 
I subconsciously forgot that even Rohan has right on me I wasn’t happy with both of them fighting over me. “So we’re back to your original terms. Drop me off at Sudha’s place and act like we have never met” I gave them an another option in order not hurt anyone. 
“No I can’t do that, I need you” Usha’s affection grew strong within just a few weeks. A mother’s love, once formed, is impossible to detach.
“See your father doesn’t say that,” she pointed Rohan. 
“If saying it were enough to make it real, I’d say it all my life.” he replied. Aww, it felt nice. Just because they aren’t expressive doesn’t mean they don’t feel anything in their heart. 
“Write these cheesy lines in your book. Don’t manipulate him” She dismissed those compliments in seconds. 
“There’s some other option, you’re not thinking of that” I hinted, having plans of making them together. 
Took a moment, a deep breath and revealed, “You can be together, and I bring Sudha as well. So, we all can be a family”
“That’s never going to happen” she responded in a split second.
“What’s problem with you Usha” Rohan asked, genuinely concerned by her reply. 
“You. What’s new problem?” I didn’t see this side of unfiltered Usha. Speaking bluntly, without thinking about whether it hurts others.
“Twenty years it’s been you still think about those 6 months we had after our marriage” He asked, nearly in tears. 
“Those six months were enough to ruin the past six years of our relationship and to make it clear that our future together wouldn’t work either.”
He walked closed towards her and gently asked, “Did I really say something that harsh? Why do you feel so unhappy living with me?” 
Immediately she moved away, showing the book in his hand, she whispered, “You know what this diary is?” took a pause, staring at his teary eyes, “It has every reason why I feel you’re not right for me. You’ve always said that writing brings clarity, so I used that approach to make my reasons clear”
“I meant sharing good memories or words, so that when we read them again, it brings us closer.” he touched the diary in her hand. 
“I sensed the other side of the coin. So, whenever loneliness hits or I start missing you, I read through what I’ve written in this book. It helps me remember why we’re not right for each other.” she built hate on him in a very organised manner. 
“Can I read that diary?” I tried grabbing it to know what is there in it. 
“No, I don’t want to ruin your impression on your dad. It’s the way he behaved to me, it has nothing to do with your bond” it made sense, and I let it go not trying to grasp it. 
“Even I don’t believe I did everything you mentioned there. Were those just your assumptions?” Rohan mentioned. 
“Why would I do that? I’m not crazy.” she didn’t agree on that. 
“Because you already had it in your mind to leave me, so no matter what I did, you saw everything in a negative light.” he explained the reason behind his claim. 
“You don’t know how many times I tried convincing myself not to get divorce. But I didn’t find any solid reason living with you. I used to cry everyday during my pregnancy, not able to figure out what to do. Meanwhile my mother, she assumes you were something ideal and she thinks I commit mistakes” now I get it why she’s mad on Sudha. 
“Now you understood how it felt when my father convinced me similar that I was the fault in our relationship. I acted and killed my attitude and stayed with you all those months” this part I have no clue what they are talking about. 
“That’s exactly why we chose to separate, for the best interests of both of us. And that’s one of our best decisions in both our lives. We are not meant to be together” I understood that my plans of being together with both have no scope. 
*******
I’ve made everything clear, things will stay the same, even half a century later. I don’t want him and that’s final.
“Okay. You don’t want to be with me, I understand you have your own reasons. But what makes me less deserving of having saran in my life?” he asked. It upset him more that I would have him, than that he wouldn’t. 
“Even, I feel being with Rohan, Usha” The kid expressed his opinion. Seeing those fancy cars, luxury house he got tempted. Seeing those fancy cars and the luxury house, he felt tempted. But the more time he spends with his dad, the more it’s clear that all he really wants is his mother. I’m confident. Or maybe he’s only bad at understanding women. For the rest of the world, he’s no less than God. This man is like that either you hate him too much or love him too much, there’s no in between.
“Fine. First, let’s see if Sudha agrees to this” Saran added. Which was true. That day, my mother made it clear: she firmly said, “If you’re not together, neither of you should have the child.” So, her agreeing to this proposal is almost impossible.
“If she agrees, then what?” Rohan asked. 
I remembered the typical style of co-parenting and spoke out, “The same that you use to do with your parents. Half of the year he spends with me and the rest half with you”
“Don’t worry much. For now, I didn’t apply for job. After my convocation I search for one and I will settle in my job city. And always my first home will be where Sudha is. If you will be together then I’ll consider that as my second home or else forget it. One thing is for sure, these six months rule I’m against it” A part of me felt proud seeing my kid express himself so genuinely and boldly. That’s how my parents raise, we share parents. 
“Then forget your second home” I responded without hesitation. 
“Usha, we’re having him after years and it’s our responsibility to look after him, doing his marriage, and many things in the future. How long Sudha should have that burden He has a point, and I feel the same, but what choice do we have? 
“So in this way you plan to be with me, huh? I know one day this is going to happen. Only our son will be the reason for us being together” Part of me knew he wasn’t aiming for that, but I couldn’t find the words to end the conversation, so I just cut it off abruptly.
“Years passed, still the same Usha I see. Selfish one, who doesn’t care about anyone,” hearing it I felt very happy. After all these years, he finally decided to speak up to my face instead of staying quiet or discussing things with others. Unbelievable. 
“Yes, as you said I can’t be a good mother,” the word selfish always reminds me this sentence. 
“Who said that I said that?” he asked as if he didn’t say it. 
“Tell me you didn’t say that?”
“No, I didn’t mean it the way you think” he tried playing smooth, but it's useless now, everything already happened. My heart broke long ago. 
“Whatever it is, even the basic meaning of it conveys too harsh” I mentioned. 
He came close to me, holding my hand “Usha what I mean is…” for the first time his touch gave a sense of irritation. 
I interrupted, “There I can see some police man. I request you to not let me create a scene here” truly when he held my hand it felt like a stranger forcing a woman. 
“On the day, I made a phone call to Uncle to discuss that I wanted to continue my job. Then he spoke same as you. He asked to discontinue for a few years. More than half and hour I explained him everything about my project and told him that this was very important,” began to explain how I knew all of this. 
“And in the end, he didn’t listen. I was still trying to convince. Finally, he said, “Rohan is right, you can never be a good mother” that was the moment I decided not to have you in my life” now he doesn’t need the whole diary to know the reason for the divorce. 
“Not yet completed. The worst part of my life didn’t even come to close. It’s when I discussed all this with my mother, she almost said the same to quit the job and was supporting you people. And that is when I decided to not have her in my life. If no one supports my career, why did they spend lakhs for my study. I’m the one carrying baby, I’m alright but you all are so much bothered about it. I hated that” I concluded, looked at Saran, regretting that the Sudha and Rohan he knew were not the same as the ones I knew. He knew a different side of Sudha and Rohan.
“And what did your father say?” Rohan asked, he now blames him for no reason. 
“You’re happy that he’s dead now? Always complaining about him, no” He hates my father. 
“Just give an answer” he demanded. 
“He supported me, he said if you think you can manage both, just do it he said” I remembered him, he was the only one who stood by my side when no one did. 
“And what if you couldn’t manage?” he acted like my father asking for the second option. 
“I didn’t get a chance though”
“No, I’m asking what if you couldn’t be able to manage. Remember he always say have a second opinion on everything” yes, I was correct he’s trying to act like my father. 
“So? That time he didn’t say like that, and I expect him to be my side” I answered. 
“That’s the problem with you. You expect to be on your side, we stand on the right side” he said thinking he’s standing on the right side, claiming that I can’t be a good mother is right side for him. 
“There’s nothing right or wrong, it’s just perception. You feel it would become difficult to manage both my career and raise the kid. I was confident that I can manage, that’s it” the cut off the conversation. 
Maybe you can manage things, but it won’t make the child into who he’s meant to be. Values and discipline can only be taught in the early years. Society still puts the ‘motherless’ tag on him.”
Now to the hate dictionary, this ‘MOTHERLESS’ word got added, “You’re thinking too much. Also, as an alternate option didn’t, I mention about the baby care centres?” I asked. 
“Those won’t work Usha” he said as if he went to a few. 
“Sudha will never be biased and that’s why she didn’t support you though you’re her daughter” Rohan supporting my mother and she supporting Rohan was a never-ending story. 
“Okay. I agree. But I expect to stand on my side. Otherwise, where’s love” I asked. 
“Love is not standing on by your side though you are wrong. It’s about correcting you” he replied. 
The word wrong tries to convince me that I’m wrong, “I’m never wrong. Don’t manipulate me”
“Okay. Fine” he ended. 
“By the way sorry for saying those words to you” he added. 
“Your sorry is a way too late and can never fix any broken part of me. I carried those words for twenty years and will carry until my last breath” I know how deep the cut was. 
“Also, I always wanted you to say this, you can never be a father” someday I should get relief not stressing everything inside in me. The words should find its home. 
“Usha, it’s not like revenge. Since he said those, now I’ll say. What are you, a small kid or what?” Saran interrupted. 
“Saran, stay out of it. Let us deal with it” his half-knowledge on our story could do nothing. 
“Don’t get me in the wrong way Rohan. I see all your interviews; I still admire you a lot. You’re the best when it comes to writing, producing a film, making blockbuster music albums, many more you do…” I genuinely feel that way. 
“Don’t just say to sooth me now. Fine. I don’t take your words to the heart” he interrupted.
“Wait. Let me complete it”
“Dealing with woman is a different thing, Rohan. You lack those qualities. First major part about it is understanding them. But you always feel you are right. You never be in that receiving position. You will listen but will not implement. You stick to your definitions, though they are outdated, you never correct them. And this quality sucks and makes you a bad father. Because a father should first be a husband and there you are a utterly failed one” I explained the reasoning as he did when he said I’m an unfit mother. 
” Yeah, I understand” felt like a wonder seeing him accepting. 
“Dad, you’re accepting just like that?” no kid wants to see his father fail. 
“Your father has this rule son, now I am not in a position of listening since I am angry, so he stays calm and expects me to change. These principles are the reason for him being like that. Let him. He deserves” slap followed by a slap I gave. 
“You are too harsh” Saran shot an angry look at me. 
“Yes, only because I planned a whole life with him and it turned me being a single mother. Every word came from the bottom of my heart, and I mean every single word” I made it clear. 
“Goodbye” I don’t want to stay long. Everything now is balanced, don’t wanted to say any extra word. 
I saw a kid staring at his helpless father in a poor condition, “Saran you are coming with me, if you want to see Sudha” I don’t want to see him like that. His dad should be a hero for him. 
“Yes, I’m coming and decided not to be with any of you two” he expressed his thoughts. 
“Your wish, I feel like talking with my mother for one last time, I drop you there and leave” I said. 
“Can I also come, don’t know how many years she lives. One last time, I too wanted to talk with her. She’s one of my favourite human beings” he asked. Both of them are very good friends and as he said we’re not sure how many years she lives. 
“One last ride” his eyes are completely filled with tears. I didn’t realise he was crying. 
“Okay” I agreed parking my scooter aside, we three started to Sudha’s place.
*** 
“Where should we head? Where is she now?” I asked so that We could take that route, since it’s a highway. 
“When I spoke to Shwetha, I realized she kept mentioning a particular place. It’s actually her birthplace. I know this because she’s talked several times about settling there with her brother. My uncle’s house is near a temple, and she had plans to live there and peacefully engage in spiritual activities.”
“Oh, so you in touch with my sister?” I asked after hearing her name. I knew that Saran was staying with them, but how did Usha know?
“No. One day I saw contact named Shwetha Aunty. I took the number and gave her a call hoping it would be her. She recognised my voice, and we talked for a whole day!” I’m sure half of that whole day talk was about me. 
“You still don’t talk to her?” she asked. 
“No, I never spoke after that day” I replied. On our last day, when Usha’s parents invited me to their home, I brought my father and Shwetha along with me. I thought that, in case I behaved inappropriately, they would be there to handle the situation. That day, after all the frustration built up, I ended up shouting at Shwetha. My last words were, “That cursed land brought us to this point. Now you’re happy that we’re separated. Don’t ever show your faces to me again. All of you go and die in that land”. Days later, I realised that was a way too harsh.  Afterwards, I often thought about meeting her in person to apologize, but I was afraid of how she might react. Besides, my life became so busy that I didn’t want anything hurtful to happen and disturb me. I have plans set for months ahead, and if something unexpected happens, everything could be ruined and my dreams shattered. So, I saw all of this as a distraction and ended up not meeting anyone, not even my father. My life lost its sense of purpose for emotional attachments once Usha was gone. Everyone laughs at me now because I haven’t seen them in years. Many times, I’ve talked about them in interviews and articles, saying things like, “They should be proud of me, wherever you are, I miss you.” But I don’t know how they actually felt about it. Maybe they thought, “He’s just saying that like any other celebrity would. If he really misses us that much, we’re just one flight away.” That was probably their opinion of me.
“Even I hadn’t spoken to her until a few days ago. She handed the land documents to me and said, “This land will never be the same for me without my brother.” That was the last time I saw her.” Everyone in our family has cut all ties and is living as if we never knew each other. 
“Will you talk now?” she asked. 
“Now?”
“Yes, what exactly are you planning when you say we’ll meet my mother? We are going to convince her, drop her off at Vizag, and then leave.” Seeing Saran through the front mirror she confirmed “Isn’t’ Shwetha’s place next to your home?” Sitting next to her in the car brought back memories of our old trips. After so many years, having a moment like this feels like a blessing. 
“Yeah. It is” he answered. 
“Ok then, I will talk. What’s big deal” I made up my mind to beg if she refused to forgive me.
“You know what happened to that land?” she asked. If she’s asking like this, it’s in good position for sure. 
“You sold it and moved to Bangalore?” 
“No, it is one of the top cafés in Hyderabad. I own sixty percent of the shares to it” she talked business. The car she was sitting in was worth more than her entire café, I wanted to point that out. Every time she thinks of winning over me, trying to prove something. I felt it wasn’t a good sign, so I decided not to buy it. It doesn’t matter to me, even if a ten-crore building is constructed on that land. 
“The share value has grown enormously; even after accounting for inflation, I’ve benefited tenfold,” she said, feeling an unnecessary sense of pride. 
“Wow. Congratulations. You’re too good at math and business” I faked my feelings. 
“According to you, it should have been running at a loss, maybe even gone bankrupt…” she said, glancing at me. Then, with a proud shrug, she added, “But that didn’t happen.” 
“Smiling, I said, “Happy that God stood by your side.”
“We could have been living happily there, spending our days playing with a boy, a girl, and Shwetha’s kids.” I hate these what ifs. Who knows what is written in destiny. 
“We can’t predict like that. Who knows?” I meant to bring her back to reality, not to take away her dreams. 
“Yeah. True. I would not be having this mental peace which I have now. Thanks to God again” she misunderstood me again. So not having me in her life brings peace. This is the nth time I’ve heard that. After all these years, meeting her again, there were no words like “I missed you,” but there were plenty about happiness and peace. I lost her. Accepted. 
Hours went by and both of them fell asleep. As night approached, I decided to find a place to stop for dinner.
“Usha, Dhaba sounds good?” I asked gently waking her. Seeing her close I got the flashes of all the fun we had. If she allows for the last time I want to grab her face, kiss all over it. I miss her face, fragrance, toes, lips, hands, bangles…. what not?
“Okay. Why are you so close” touching her hand she said I’ll complaint to police, now she files a rape case against me. 
“Can I kiss you?” all I see is her innocent independent women eyes who lowkey wants to depend on his man, but her ego is stopping this. 
“One last time?” I put my hands on her cheeks, gently rubbing them soft. 
Cheking with saran and we confirmed that he was in a deep sleep. “How much time you take? Not like those college kisses. Just a peck”
“No. then I don’t want” it’s been years I have an rough idea how passionate it’s going to be. And if I agree with her again she gets angry and calls that misbehaviour. 
“Then, don’t” she turned aside. I kissed her on the cheeks. She shot an angry look. 
“Enough. Sorry”
“Come, let’s go. Order some food first”
“you dind’t answer to my question”
“What?”
“How many minutes it takes”
“Untill I feel like leaving, maybe I won’t. so unless you throw me out” and her lips were on mine.
