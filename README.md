“Call your mother and tell her to cook brinjal,” she passed me the telephone. 
“Even though, I don’t tell. She’ll do that,” I said.  Long ago Rohan complimented something like ‘This is the best brinjal curry I’ve ever had’ and the rest is history. Every time she cooks the same and he compliments adding something extra making it extra special. 
“This time I will not hesitate to say anything on your father face,” he hesitated. Many interaction of theirs were not smooth. My father is overly discipline and expects an answer for everything. And Rohan is complete go with the flow guy. He have plans but he doesn’t have an answer when you ask what if it fails. My father then suggests rohan to have an alternate plans parallelly and there he says ‘I’ll figure out something then’. Argument goes for hours and in the end, no one wins. Just time gets completed and we start to our home. Both being straightforward persons make it worse, they say many mean things on face, still with a smile they’ll continue their arguments. 
“Have you ever hesitated before?” I was surprised when he mentioned ‘this time’
“Why is he like that?” he asked. Now how can I explain this to him that this was an actual discipline but not those punishments he give and make us write apologising letters. 
Wanted to say what I felt but I ended up saying, “you know he worked in the defence and that discipline is in his veins. Can’t help it”
“Discipline? Bull shit” now in his nerves is this unnecessary angry. 
“If I now say I’m writing songs then he asks me who listens to songs and tells me to find some other job. Discouraging is discipline for you?”, said Rohan, his voice increasing when the sentence came to an end. I’m sure my father won’t react this worst as he expected. He might ask the possibilities of getting success but that doesn’t mean discouraging. Constructive criticism should be taught to him immediately. 
I was calm when he did those claims on my father. Not because they were true but because I don’t know what I will I face if I slip my tongue. Maybe this time he won’t talk for years. I was scared. So I managed with a smile and a nod gesturing he was right. 
We reached my home. Seeing our parents after a long time gives the same vibe weather you’re married or not. Because this is your first home and it feels the same for every visit.
AMMA! The only hug I craved for. When you ask someone whom do you like most between your mother and father. Everyone says it’s difficult to comment that. But I am sure about it that I love my mother more. A little more maybe. My father is strict which taught me discipline in many things but the leniency she gave me defined all my life moments. I share almost everything with her. In fact, she helped in our marriage convincing my father. I love her. Now I don’t want to compare that with the love I get from Rohan. It’s different. I’m supposed to share my life with him, and with parent’s I’ve given my whole time since childhood. When the timelines changed comparison would be vague. They played their roles in their timeline and taken care of me to the best. 
“Hi Uncle,” greeted Rohan. He calls my parents as uncle and aunt. Even I follow the same naming with his parents. Since we use to visit each other houses when we’re at college we still feel them as friends parents but not as my husbands parents. 
“Hi Rohan. How’s life?” excitingly my father replied back. And there we go the intense discussion is going to talk soon. Time to leave this room with my mother and go somewhere. We have our girls topics to talk about.
