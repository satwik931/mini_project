Before giving him his favorite poha I made, I signaled for him to answer, “Tell me how much you missed me?” Otherwise, I wouldn’t give it to him.
He put the plate aside, got up, pulled me into his arms, and started spinning me in circles. “This much,” he kept saying, while I was lifted off the ground, analyzing my living room blur, rotating with speed of 30 rotation per minute. 
He was unable to sense I was being serious and expected a genuine answer, not his playful romance. 
I left the conversation unfinished, and if I attempt to revisit it, he doesn’t hesitate to remind me that I once said, “What’s the point of living if you don’t express yourself emotionally?”
“Hey, it won’t hurt the baby inside you?” he set me down gently.
“The baby isn’t formed yet. At this stage, it’s just a single cell inside me, not like the way you imagine: a whole body, head, and everything already there” I explained his missed biology lectures. 
“Obviously. I’m not dumb to assume the whole baby was in this barely visible stomach. I meant if rotating like this hurt you,” he responded. Thank God, or else he would have said it was the spin’s fault if the baby was born with a deformity. 
“No, it won’t hurt” I smiled and asked “You could have done all this fun stuff in the past weeks as well” a part of me is dying to know how much he missed me. 
“You could also have made many of my favorite dishes in the previous weeks,” he acted over smart. 
“These Two things never change, One, the beauty of taj mahal and two, getting you to admit your mistakes” I spoke, aware that arguing with someone who won’t listen goes nowhere.
“Yes. Two things that never change, One, taj mahal, two, your inability to see my point of view,” he copied my theme and shot back at me. 
“Thanks,” I mentioned as I saw it as a compliment. 
“Wait, tell me one thing” tapping on my stomach, I asked “If this wasn’t a part of me, how many more months would it have taken you to come to me?”
“Takes as long as you take to come to me,” he answered instantly. 
Seeing his usual ego-driven attitude, I asked. “What have you gained from being this way all these months?”
“That depends on what you’ve lost. Is your behavior proper now? Have you let go of all those useless habits you had?” What the hell was that word ‘BEHAVIOUR’. Oh, now he thinks I’m the problem and is trying to teach me how to behave in society. If we leave him like this, he’ll end up saying everyone is wrong except himself.
“I’m the same person with no changes. And I never need to be corrected. I’m just fine as I am,” In anger, I hit the table with my leg, causing the plate of poha to fall to the floor. So now he goes to the kitchen himself, serves the food, and enjoys the poha made by the women he calls misbehaved.
These days, I often ask myself how I’ve been with him for six years, and what changed in these past two months that made life with him feel so different.
Answer to this is simple, it’s “MARRIAGE”. Not every transformation is smooth. In college four years we have many friends around us to distract ourselves. In the past two years though we were living together, it’s with zero responsibilities. Almost every day in those two years, we was emotionally inactive, all we do is watch some romance movies, have food, sex and that’s it. Even though I say something about him to others, it’s like me saying something about Rohan. But now it seems I’ve turned into a woman who complains about her husband and exposes our household drama with all the neighbors. The smallest things we did for fun have now become the most serious things. How many times have I teased him about his salary, saying he earns only half as much as I do, But saying it after marriage created a scene, as if I had turned against my husband and was trying to take control of the house.
I understand this overhaul and decided to take this slow. Give ourselves enough time and learn from experiences to become the best versions. I brought all my bedding into his room to show that it was the beginning of something new, but once again, I was the one making the compromise.
He arranged all the bedding neatly and made it a comfortable place. Now the question is whether he still loves the unchanged, so-called misbehaved Usha, or if his love is just for his new daughter, Sree Gayatri.
Being treated like a princess feels wonderful but it becomes disappointing when you realize it was only given because they thought you were a real princess. That’s exactly how all of this feels now.
“Is it okay to make love during this time?” he asked. Here I am, worrying about how to fix our relationship, while he’s focused on having the same sex we’ve already done nearly seven hundred times. I don’t know what to say. 
“Things are never feeling like before, Rohan. I never thought I’d survive months without speaking to you. I don’t have a pinch of shame to admit that I’m completely dependent on you and can’t live without you. Just because I’m here doesn’t mean I’m okay. You can’t judge my well-being by my mere existence. Ever tried talking to me? f you had, I would have just broken down and cried like a child. Why are you behaving like this?,” I expressed every thought without thinking it through. 
“Why are you behaving like this? You are asking me? You slammed the table and reacted dramatically, you said so many hurtful things to me; you treated me like I was nothing. Despite everything you did, I stayed calm, hoping you’d eventually realize your mistake. And in return instead of accepting it you are blaming me now. Not you, I should ask you. Why are you behaving like this Usha?” He uses the same copycat formula on me and tries to manipulate me.
“Should we give ourselves a little more time before talking again?” I asked so that I can come with a solid solution and fix things. 
“No, you need someone during this time. We will fight like this, but in the same room,” he proposed something which he never follows. 
“Even that you don’t do, Rohan. After some time when I say something, you just stay calm carrying the worst theory you had: “While someone’s in anger they won’t be in a position of accepting anything” Bullshit theory it is. First try telling and then see if I really don’t listen, do not walkaway like a coward,” I raised my voice out of anger.
“See, how many things are getting added to the hurt list,” he said, and this was something to boost my rage like anything. For the first time, I want more than just words, I want to slap him hard for making me feel mentally unstable and depressed.
“Don’t test my patience, Rohan. I’m not like you, I don’t know what will happen if you stay here. Please go outside, or come back after half an hour, or when I’ve fallen asleep,” I threw his pillow gesturing him to get out. The worst part is, we can’t sleep when we need it the most
“Okay” he said leaving the room. If he just hugged me tighter and let me cry, everything would be okay. But I see him walking carelessly without having thoughts of fixing our bond.
I fell asleep, and in the morning, I found Rohan beside me. I have no idea when he came next to me. 
“Good morning,” I acted as if nothing had happened yesterday. 
“Good morning, baby,” he kissed my forehead. He too acted well. 
“Shwetha and Vishnu are visiting our home today,” he told. 
“But they didn’t say anything,” This place is like a mess. I need time to make it clean. 
“When I called them yesterday to say your pregnancy news, they felt happy and decided to visit us today”
“Oh, Okay. At what time?” I asked. 
“Maybe in next one hour,” he replied. 
***
“Congratulations Dear,” Shwetha hugged me. 
“Don’t talk to me. You didn’t say a single word about it,” Vishnu got upset with me. 
“Tomorrow at the office, I wanted to say it in person, that’s why,” I extended my arms towards him, gesturing for a hug.
“I know Rohan is hoping for a girl. Long ago he shared his hope of having five girls. In which three are ours,” she saw Vishnu and they were like we can do it, just three kids. 
“Hopefully, she turns out to be a girl” I said. The manifestation should be so powerful that, in the end, if it’s a boy it turns to a girl.
“Five girls. With us confused about their names, and they are playing on the two floors together. Wow. Life is going to be good soon,” Shwetha dreamt. Now, only God can protect the house we took and kept hidden from Rohan.
Realizing she’d slipped, she immediately bit her lip and shot Rohan a strange look. 
“Two floors?” he caught the main point. 
“The duplex we are going to build,” Vishnu interrupted not having the idea that Swetha and I decided to keep this hidden from Rohan. 
“Oh, in the same land that we discussed previously?” he asked, seeing all three of us. 
“Yes, we bought it a month ago,” Vishnu whispered. 
“Oh, you three are going to be there?” this was a bold way of saying something. 
“Rohan, now you’re having children. You should have assets for security. Don’t behave like a child. Purchasing it helped us, now that this baby owns a property,” explained Shwetha pointing my belly. 
“Yeah, I agree. We could have bought some good lands, no?” he continued. 
“Who gives you 7 cents of land just for 2 lakhs?” she asked. I’m praying that this discussion should not turn towards me. Siblings should deal with this and close hear itself. 
“Don’t you have commonsense to discuss with me before paying our share, Usha?” He abruptly ended the conversation and turned to face me. Suddenly, all the attention was on me.
“No. I don’t have common sense. As you said I should change a lot and learn how to behave,” I gave a broad smile and attempted to quench his rage all at once. 
“Can we talk about this later and spent some time with this couple,” I carried that smile while talking.  “Please,” I requested.
