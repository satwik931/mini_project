“Now that you’re here, it still doesn’t feel like home,” she murmured walking from the room. These days, she just speaks without thinking. 
I kept quiet, once more. Years of your love is now complaining your very existence. I don’t know which incident made her like this. She expects me to say something, but what am I supposed to say when her words are so hurtful? I’m the only one who can tolerate this; imagine any other woman buying something worth lakhs without informing her husband, how would he react?  It would never be forgiven. He slaps her like anything and never trusts her. If all she wants is some reaction, I can do that. That’s not how I wanted to behave. We are educated and shouldn’t be dealing that. So, I chose to make her understand by giving her time and forgive for the nth time. Additionally, writing things down on paper deepens understanding, and rereading them later strengthens your connection. Also overthinking can be avoided and straight solutions are found. She disagreed doing that. I have no idea what she wants these days. She complains about everything.

No matter how often I try to speak with her these days, she ignores me every time. She wakes up so early, even before I finish freshening up. She goes to her office by herself, cook her own food. Our last conversation was about taking a break for a few more days. Maybe she’s just following that now. I’m unsure how many days that few days mean. Usha’s stomach has started to grow, and I just want to spend some time with her, talking about everything, being together. All I need is her permission.
Two weeks passed and things were the same. I decided to put this before our so they can help us find a solution. First, I spoke with my father and made arrangements to visit our home. Usha listens to my father.

Coming home from the office, her face glowed as she saw my father in the living room. “Hi Uncle!” she said excitedly. 
“How are you, Usha. All good?” my father maintained the same excitement. 
“Excellent” she replied. Though that’s a false answer. 
“Just came from Shwetha’s house”
“How are they doing? Though I see Vishnu everyday. How’s Shwetha it’s been weeks,” she spoke taking a comfortable seat at the sofa. But not next to me. 
“Yeah. They are doing great They said they’re planning to have kids soon, so I might have two granddaughters within a few months,” my father once imagined how wonderful his future was going to be. I can’t correct him, but when he said they’re planning for kids, I felt the same dislike I always have for such talk.
“These people also constructed a house for you grandchildren. Don’t worry,” I interrupted. I hated my wife not sitting next to me in front of my father. 
“Yeah, Shwetha told me. Very good decision. Proud that you’re having some assets on your name by a very young age,” he replied. So, it’s like all are one team who is playing against me. 
“Good decision? You know why that land costs for such a low price?” I didn’t hesitate. 
“Previously, it was a temple. Rohan c’mon. Don’t act silly. Opportunities don’t give any signs before they come, they just come like that and we should sense them,” I was surprised seeing my father talking like this. As you get older, you should become more inclined to believe in God.
“Yes, Dad I’m the silliest person. A big fool. Enough about this topic. It already caused my wife and me to stop talking for months,” I remembered where all these misunderstandings started. “That’s why I said not to buy these lands,” I concluded. 
“You stopped talking to me because of this land, and now you’re blaming the land for everything that’s happened. Are you out of your mind?” She went to the kitchen, probably to get some snacks and give me some space to talk to my father. 
“What’s going on Rohan?” My father asked, making sure she was not nearby.
“I don’t know Dad. We haven’t really spoken in months, and that’s actually the main reason I called you. Seeking some solution to it,” I laid it all out.
“Why? There will be some reason, right?”
“We are different. Not meant to stay together” I lowered my head in shame as I spoke.
“How did you manage for years then?” He asked the same question about where I’m getting stuck. 
“Because there came something in between: MARRIAGE. And she never feels the same, she can be a girlfriend. But as a wife, I doubt it,” I lowered my voice, making sure my wife couldn’t hear.
“What is the difference?” 
“Life of wife has the mother role in it. And I doubt she could be a good one”
“You can’t say that. If she hears this, it will really hurt her feelings. Such words can be deeply painful for a girl. Never say that again,” he warned me, and it hit me that what I said was far too much. No girl deserves that.
“No, No, what I’m trying to say is motherhood begins when you start putting others before yourself.  She needs to move beyond self-centeredness to be a good wife. There comes a point where you should be by your husband side though the whole world is against you. Same with the child, you should not care to leave your job for spending time with him in his initial years. Now, ask her to quit the job and listen what she says, then you’ll understand why I’m talking like this” I tried using simple words this time. 
“Do you think Shwetha quits the job during her pregnancy?” he questioned, and I didn’t get why he is asking this. 
“Is it relevant?”
“Son, these days no one’s like you are thinking. Things changed. Happy that both are earning livelihood. Get that positive perception. How would it feel when I ask you to quit the writing?”
“Dad. Are you serious? How can you relate this with my writing?”
“It’s your favourite job. So that’s hers. Makes sense?” that moment I understood even my father got brainwashed and is trying to fit in this wrong society forgetting his roots. 
“Okay. Talk to her something and solve this if possible” I requested him, having a tiny hope that his words would create some magic and fix us. 
“Go and call her” he demanded though I asked him to do that. 
“Not shouting her name from here. Go to the room she was in and bring her” he ordered when I’m about to shout and escape the task. 
Slowly I sat next to her and gave an awkward simle. “Dad is calling us,” smile broadened. 
“Us?”
“Yeah. He wants to talk to us”
“What have you said?” she asked tensed. The impression my father had on her shouldn’t be spoiled. 
“What’s going on between us”
“So, this won’t come under misbehaviour?” she lost her nerves. Trying to win over me since I mentioned the word ‘MISBEHAVE’ when she shared it with Shwetha. 
“About this only he wanted to talk. Please come” I took her hand and requested. 
“Uncle” 
“Both of you have a seat” he pointed the same sofa so that we sit on the same. 
“After your mother and I got separated, many times, I felt like going back to her. But I always wondered, “What if she doesn’t accept me?” So I never tried and just kept all those feelings inside,” even I didn’t know he missed my mom. 
“Uncle but we don’t have thoughts of getting divided. We just wanted to give some break” she said, which was true. I always complained that she was not in the right track for now. But that doesn’t mean I will abandon her, I just want to see her change. And I hope she will. 
“Taking break for a long time is what divorce is” he cut her long sentence with a solid reply. “It starts like this Usha, taking breaks, trying new things, and you know, this generation people have many options available with them. So you should mentally be strong. Not even a single thought of having breaks. Work on it, Work on it. Don’t leave like that”
“I tried many times. He doesn’t cooperate” what the hell is wrong with this woman. 
“Same dad, she never listens to me” I added my side of complaint. 
“I can understand. It’s so new to accept the change. Soon, you’ll understand why there’s a saying “Having a baby will save your relationship” And believe me, It becomes so difficult when there’s no one to look after you as you grow older.” he gave the pieces of knowledge he had. 
“You may not believe this, but these days I’m working on getting back with your mother” he said, and it blew my mind. 
“Seriously dad? You used to hate her. Remember?” being more with him, partially created some sort of negative impression on my mom too. 
“yeah, only because I loved her. After you left me, a few months I spent with Shwetha. Then I understood why a woman misunderstood me and the way I behave was not suited for them. It’s understandable. You can’t be same to all Rohan. There’s a way. You can’t go to a kid and say the whole Disneyland is a lie, though it’s true, it hurts the kid”
“So?”
“Sorry Usha, it’s my fault I don’t know how to raise a man who can be liked by a woman. I can’t learn that because I’m never good at that. A failed one”
“dad you’re blaming on you all this? Stop it”
“No son. These are facts. I can understand how Usha feels being with you”
“Please I beg you. My son will soon change and don’t make this bond break”
