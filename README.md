# mini_project

I'm currently writing a fictional story. Which was half-completed. Instead of finishing the total can I upload my work as far as I finished? Since all at once might take time, Parallelly I write and update my work and meanwhile would you proofread my written work? Whom should I consider to proofread my book?
