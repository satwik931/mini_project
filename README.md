“We’re home,” I saw Vishnu in the living room watching television. 
“Hey Hi,” Vishnu greeted me. still stuck at those very formal greetings. Usha know him well, not me. 
“How’s everything going in office,” my next formal conversational question. 
“All good. How’s your stuff going. Office, books,..many things you do” he laughed, the laugh which make me proud. 
“Ugh..Well. evertyhing’s going great. Want to add a few more new things to that list” I love to flex my work, maybe not in a direct way but somehow that should reach ears of all nearby. 
“Oh. Now surprise me saying you’re going to make a film with your stories,” he revealed one of my future plans. 
“Wanted to do that for sure. But now I’m writing a few songs. Searching for a good music band to collobarate with”
“That’s interesting. You only sing? Or make others to sing?” 
“That hadn’t been yet decided. If my vocals suits well, I will release as some private album. If not give I’ll give to the excisiting singers and make bonds”
“Years ahead and we see you somewhere unreachable” “Don’t forget us then” he added. This I here often but why would I forget. I might be busy and time I give them might decrease but that doesn’t mean I have forgotten them. The same smile I get whenever I remember any memories stuck between us. 
“Shwetha is my own sister, and you are my only brother-in-law. Why would I forget just like that. Never,” I reassured all their insecurities. 
  “He says like that. Even now he barely comes to visit us. Once is a month, huh?” Shwetha came from the kitchen, interrupted our talk. 
“Then should I stay with you or what?” I asked. 
“If that’s possible. We can stay together if we built a duplex house. Two storeyed building”
“Sounds good. Are you serious?” 
“Yes, Vishnu and I saw a plot with a decent price. We didn’t yet negiotate it, wanted to discuss with you.”
“Empty land in Hyderabad? That’s rare. What’s the matter? That’s definitely road extension to be gone land for sure”
“No. it’s not like that. It’s in the center of the city. But no one is buying it”
“Reason?”
“I don’t know but someone there said that previously there used to be a restaurant there, but it was utterly disaster and ran in losses in a way that owner need to sell all his other branches to recover this loss” 
“That’s common. Because he needs to pay the lease for this land and it’d be huge. So he decided to do that”
“Also a lot of fine. Some food-posion happened one day”
“Oh, that’s unfortunate” 
“People are strnage they see this and build own tales around it”
“Like”
“Previously there used to be a small temple established by nearby village people. Then they made a small paper -goods small scale industry. There was a fire accident and it was disster. After a few years it became a hotel and even it did not work well”
“So everyone started saying ‘Don’t mess with god, right?,” Usha interruppeeted with a careless saying. 
“Exactly” both laughed in unison. 
“That’s true. Never mess with lord,” I said. That’s my opinion and it’s basic. He’s the creator and you are challenging him. A small place can be devoted for worship. Desrtroying it for our selfish purposes leads to these consequences. 
“C’mon Rohan. Talk like educated. You know how often there’s a room for a fire accident in industieds, that too flammable papers”
“Educated? Education must do nothing in believing God”
“I’m not complaining about your belief in God. But in those blind faiths and funny fairy tales that we make”
“Maybe those are not funny. And what about the food poisoning then?” I asked. 
“A rare probability. their time was not good then, that’s it”
“I don’t think so” 
“Okay. Okay let us leave this topic here” interrupted Vishnu and tried to cut this discussion halfway. 
“True. Anyway we are not going to buy it, prlonging this discussion would lead to nothing new” I let all my opinion boldly thorough this. 
“We’re not buying it?” Shwetha asked her voice sounded like sad tone. 
“Listen to me Shwetha. You know me very well, right? It’s not good for us. We will buy some other land” 
“Okay”
“What else? Vishnu’s how’s your post marriage life. Intense romance filled? When am I going to become aunt?” 
“Soon, maybe” both blushed seeing each others face. 
“Cool. Planning this year only” 
“I said there’s nothing like planning” I interrupted because I hate it when someone says planning when it comes to kid. It should happen with flow. 
“Ush…I’m talking to them, no? Keep your philosophical science aside. Anyway, I must hear those in our home” 
“Wow. New name for it. Philosophies. Great”
“How’s everything with you Usha” Shwetha asked. 
“See we argue like this the whole day. After one month he is kind now and talking to me”
“One month?”
“Rohan are you mad? You know how it feels when no ones talks to you. How can you leave her like that”
“Yes, I observed her in office everyday she was off. Even she didn’t share anything with me when I asked many times the reason” 
“How can you know that feeling. You have those books to write. Now what songs”
“Everyone can not enjoy their solitude. Many want them to be checked once in a while” 
“I know, but she did not tell the reason behind my behaviour”
“No matter what, learn to forgive and do it”
“That’s why we are talking now as usual”
“But one month is still a big amount of time. She gets stressed in office and expects a quality time in home and imagine home being like this”
“Yeah. I get it. I will never do that again”
“My boy. Very good” Shwetha hugged me and elderly sisters advice are blessings. 
“I wanted to say this Rohan. But that’s true, those days felt like hell. Happy that we’re good now but never ever taste those kinds of days again for me. Those were the real  nightmares”
“Understood. I will not”
During our lunch again the meal topic turned towards the land which we wanted to construct our house.
‘How much does that land cost?,” asked Usha. 
“Two and half lakhs, 7 cent land” 
“Oh, 7 cent would be a huge”
“We can have a graden, too” Vishnu said. 
“Nice. Two and half lakhs is  a way too good deal. If not this price that would cost around 5 to 6 lakh in the centre of the city”
“That’s why I’m thinking about it repeatedly. Limited deal, should be cautious before someone grabs it”
“You’re good at making biryani Shwetha. Tell me dad taught you,” tried distracting the current useless topic. 
“Yeah, dad taught me almost everything that I cook. For me too. Same pinch” Usha pinched her. 
“That’s why I can’t differentiate when you put the two dishes made by you aside. Both tastes alike” 
After our lunch, we four of us played cards. Talked about random politics, gossipes and just like that it became evening (sun started to set) and we decide to leave. 
“Bye, Shwetha” 
“Think about that land, I took his phone number and didn’t give him a call back since I did not discuss with you” 
“I am on my words from the beginning. My decision is final”
“He says like that only Shwetha, you agree and I will pay our part”
“You will pay?”
“I mean us, come” 
What does this mean. He says like that only? Are my words not considered? What the hell pronoun ‘I’ doing in the sentence I will pay. It’s supposed to be ‘we’.
